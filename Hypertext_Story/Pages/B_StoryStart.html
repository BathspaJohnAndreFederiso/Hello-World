                Today is Grandma's birthday.
                Your grandmother could be harsh sometimes to you, especially when you were growing up, but you and her were quite close.
                In fact, you made sure to visit her whenever its her birthday, but due to some unfortunate circumstances you missed her birthday last year. You want to make up for it this year….but how?

                You lived alone in your household a bit far away from the nearest town (you were quite the recluse), but Grandma's house was just one or two hours away from you, give or take.
                If you want to surprise her, you better start early. You look to your small, humble kitchen for inspiration.

                Hmm. There isn't much but you spot your baking implements, as well as some leftover ingredients. 
                That's it! You're going to bake a cake! Just one problem though, you don't have enough sugar. Where are you going to get those?
                Maybe your neighbors have some?
