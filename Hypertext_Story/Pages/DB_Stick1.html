                You decide to visit your pig neighbor that lives in the stick house.
                It's a bit of a long walk from there, but you make it just before noon.
                You soon arrive at a very shoddy shack, made out of sticks. It's a wonder that your neighbor actually lives in something that can be easily toppled.
                You knock as gently as you can on the house's entrance.

            <p>

                "O-open that door and you'll really regret it!" You hear the house's occupant scream out, followed by what seems to be the sound of a gun cocking!
                You instinctively step aside, as if he's going to shoot through the door right then and there. What's his problem, anyway?

            </p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <p>

                You, very politely, ask him if he has what you need.

            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>

                ...the door creaks very slowly. 
                A long, metal barrel peeks out between the door and the frame, then followed by the rest of the rifle, held by a hairy, pink pig man. He looks like he hasn't slept for days.

            </p>

            <p>
                “ Come any closer and I won't hesitate! If what you're saying is true...then what do you want?!"
