                You decide to follow the trail of canine footprints, to settle this once and for all. 
                Your newfound companion follows you, weapon in hand and ready. You hope that he will not have a reason to use it.

                You hadn't visited Grandma's house in over a year so your memory of the way there was a bit spotty, but what you did remember, you were sure these tracks led there…
                Eventually, the tracks lead to a familiar sight...a small cottage in the thick of the woods. The windows are lit, and smoke is coming out of the chimney. The occupant must be awake.
                You see the prints leading to the entrance of the house.
