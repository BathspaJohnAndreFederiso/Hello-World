                No time to waste, you burst in through the door. Your neighbor's got your back. You were not prepared for what you see.
                It's Grandma, hunched over a pot...it looks like she's cooking something. Not a something, **someone**. Your other pig neighbor, from the looks of it.

        <div>
            <p>
                "Eh? Oh, I can explain..."  Your grandma sheepishly says. You move to help your neighbor, but not before telling her that she'll be facing the consequences.
                Your neighbor’s got his gun trained on your Grandma. You only hope that she doesn’t do anything rash. <br />

                Surprisingly, she relents without much of a fuss. You thank her for not trying to escalate the situation. You didn't want to fight your own family.
                After helping your neighbor out of the pot, you then call the police.
                They arrive not too long, taking care of the rest.
                It's been a long day...
