                Slowly and surely, you and your neighbor make your way to one of the windows, careful to not make any noise that might alert the occupants. You are not prepared for what you see. It's Grandma, hunched over a pot...it looks like she's cooking something. It's not a something, it's a **somebody** getting cooked, and it looks like one of your neighbor’s brothers!
                Before you could act, your companion beats you to the punch.
                "I knew it! Why I oughtta..." He raises his gun to the window, taking aim. You’re too late to stop him before he fires.




            </p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <p>
                To your relief, he missed. The shot spooks everyone else present.
                You look back inside the house, and you see that Grandma's already made a run for it.
                Your companion's already entering the house to check on his brother. "He's still breathing! Help me take him out of the pot!” You quickly oblige.
            </p>


        </div>

        <div>
            <p>


                You help him take his brother out from the cooking pot.
                She had not started boiling him yet, so there was no risk of getting burned.
                He doesn't seem to be too injured, but he's definitely passed out from the ordeal.
                You and your neighbor plop him down your Grandma's couch.
                The both of you take a breather, stressed out from the turn of events that just ensued. "Good thing we got here in time..." You say. He wordlessly nods.


            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                You're just glad that (almost) everyone's okay. You go to call the police, while your neighbor tends to his brother.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <img src="../img/police.jpg" alt="police" />
        </div>

        <div>
            <p>
                Months later after that entire ordeal, you never saw your Grandma again. Whether she's still in the forest somewhere or left for parts unknown, you haven't the slightest clue.
                On the bright side you're pretty good friends with your neighbors (except for the one in the brick house) now, no doubt due to your daring rescue.
                You even come over to each other's house whenever it's someone's birthday.
