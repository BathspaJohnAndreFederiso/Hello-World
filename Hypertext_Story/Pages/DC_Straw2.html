                That's odd. Where there should be a house, there just isn't anything at all.
                Just piles of straw everywhere. Perhaps that's what remained of your neighbor's house? Something's amiss here, maybe you should look around.




            </p>
        </div>


        <div>
            <p>

                You quickly search through what remains of the straw house. No sign of anyone.
                You could continue looking around, but anyone who had lived here <em>or done this...</em> might come back at any time.
                You certainly don't want to leave empty-handed.
