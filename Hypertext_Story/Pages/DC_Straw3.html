                You hang around for a bit, seeing if you had missed anything of importance. <br />

                And in fact, you did. You find that there is a trail of footprints leading back into the forest. Upon closer inspection they looked very canine, eerily similar to your own... <br />

                Suddenly, you hear some commotion come from the forest.

                Eventually, the continued noises gave way to the sound of clamouring of people and voices. 
                You watch as a group of people from the nearby town, led by a pig man (your other neighbor?) surround the area. Looks like they've been following the trail too. <br />

                "See! I t-told you it was one of them wolf-folks, up to no good!" <br />

                The pig man leading the group stutters, pointing at you. As if on cue, the mob surrounds you. 
                You very quickly realize this isn't a good look for you, being on the site of what might be a crime with evidence painting YOU as the culprit.
