                You arrive at your destination, a house made of straw, in record time.
                You knock on the door (as gently as you can, it's made of straw).
                A pig man answers the door. He looks like a bit startled at the sight of a wolf person at his doorstep, but at least he hasn't done anything rash...yet.
                "Oh! I wasn't expecting any visitors today." You ask him if you can enter, and the answer surprises you.

        <div>
            <p>

                "It would be my pleasure. Come in!" You gladly oblige.

                Your visit is surprisingly less awkward and more friendly than you expected.
                Your pig neighbor was very accommodating and amicable.
                In fact, he's preparing some refreshments right after he invited you in, and you haven't even asked about the sugar yet!
                You see the pig man come back from the kitchen, freshly-made sandwiches in hand.

            </p>

            <p>
                "You know, for a moment back there I thought what my brothers said about you was true. But now I know they were just being their usual, paranoid selves."
                "So, what brought you over?" He asks as he places the snacks on the table.
                You ask him if he has some sugar he could lend you. As you take a small bite out of your own sandwich, you ask him if you could borrow some sugar. It's for your granny's birthday, you say.
