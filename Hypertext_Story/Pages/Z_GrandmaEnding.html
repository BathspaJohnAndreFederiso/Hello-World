                Soon after, you made sure to visit your grandmother as much as you can in prison. She's being treated pretty well, on the account of surrendering peacefully and being old. You also did get her that cake, courtesy of your neighbors (except for that one that lived in the brick house) who surprisingly didn't hold a grudge against her for too long.
                On the bright side you're pretty good friends with your neighbors now, no doubt due to your daring rescue. You even come over to each other's house whenever it's someone's birthday.
