                You try explaining yourself to the angry mob. They didn't seem to be in the mood for talking, but you tried your best.

                The mob didn't seem to be in the mood for a reasonable discussion, as they went ahead and attacked you.
                Your instincts kicking in, you defended yourself. But you were quickly overpowered and knocked out in the ensuing chaos.

                When you came to, you find yourself in a heavily guarded cell. They must think they got the culprit.
                You were locked away for life, accused for a crime you vehemently insisted to the court you did not commit.
